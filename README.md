# React Game - SOS & Chain Reaction

Welcome to the React Game repository! This project features two exciting dual player games, SOS and Chain Reaction, built using React.

## Features

- **SOS Game**: Challenge a friend in this classic game of pattern recognition. The objective is to form as many SOS sequences as possible within a limited time. Take turns with your opponent placing letters on the grid to create vertical, horizontal, or diagonal SOS combinations. The player with the most SOS sequences wins!
- **Chain Reaction Game**: Engage in a strategic battle against your friend where the goal is to capture the entire board. Place your tokens on the board strategically, and each token you place will trigger an explosion, capturing neighboring cells. Plan your moves wisely to create chain reactions and outsmart your opponent. The player who occupies the entire board first emerges victorious!

Additional Features:

- **Google Sign-In**: Easily sign in to the game using your Google account for a seamless and personalized experience.
- **Share Game Code**: Invite your friend to join the game by sharing a unique code. Compete head-to-head and see who has the skills to prevail.
- **Game History**: View past game details including the game name, game code, opponent's email, and whether the game is ended or in progress. Determine who emerged as the winner or if the game ended in a draw.
